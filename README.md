## Practice Test Release Notes

**June 2017** - *CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS* - Begin updating the set of practice test questions to match the most recent objective changes to the Developing Microsoft Azure Solutions (70-532) certification exam from November 2016. This was the most major update to the exam that Microsoft has done to date. The exam update includes removing all ASM (Azure Service Management) questions and adding in all the awesome ARM (Azure Resource Management) stuff instead. This update included removing Cloud Services from the exam as that service is now legacy.

**March 2016** - Microsoft updated the objectives on the 70-532 certification exam in March 2016. These practice questions were updated a little to match. Most of the updates this time were to remove the Azure Portal UI references from the questions, as the exam does not test you on the everchanging Azure Portal UI.

**June 2015** - Initial release of the first and only Open Source set of practice test / exam questions for the Developing Microsoft Azure Solutions (70-532) certification exam.
