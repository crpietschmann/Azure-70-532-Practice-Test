The 4 additional slots can be used for staging and testing purposes. Slots are also known as "staging environments" and more info can be found at: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/app-service/plans/

            Which deployment scenario does the following describe?<br/>
			<br/>
			Your Web App requires you to make some changed post deployment. You deploy to a non-production slot so you can first make those changes before finally swapping with the production slot.

            Where are all deployment slots for the same Web App hosted?
        </section>
        <section class="answer">Within a separate virtual machine (VM) instance as the Production deployment slot</section>

		<section class="answer" data-correct>Within the same virtual machine (VM) instance as the Production deployment slot</section>
		<section class="answer">Within a separate physical machine as the Production deployment slot</section>
		<section class="description">
			All deployment slots for the same Web App are hosted within the same Virtual Machine (VM). This is especially important to remember when stress testing a non-production deployment slot prior to swapping it into production. A significant amount of load on a non-production deployment slot can affect the performance of the live, production Web App.
