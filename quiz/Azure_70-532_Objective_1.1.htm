		<section class="description">
			All deployment slots for the same Web App are hosted within the same Virtual Machine (VM). This is especially important to remember when stress testing a non-production deployment slot prior to swapping it into production. A significant amount of load on a non-production deployment slot can affect the performance of the live, production Web App.
