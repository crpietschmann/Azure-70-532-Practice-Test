			Deploy to a non-production slot to test whether the Web App is working as expected. Then after you are satisfied with testing, you swap this slot with the production slot making the contents of this slot the new production Web App.

            Which deployment scenario does the following describe?<br/>
			<br/>
			Your Web App requires you to make some changed post deployment. You deploy to a non-production slot so you can first make those changes before finally swapping with the production slot.

            Where are all deployment slots for the same Web App hosted?
        </section>
        <section class="answer">Within a separate virtual machine (VM) instance as the Production deployment slot</section>

		<section class="answer" data-correct>Within the same virtual machine (VM) instance as the Production deployment slot</section>
		<section class="answer">Within a separate physical machine as the Production deployment slot</section>
		<section class="description">
			All deployment slots for the same Web App are hosted within the same Virtual Machine (VM). This is especially important to remember when stress testing a non-production deployment slot prior to swapping it into production. A significant amount of load on a non-production deployment slot can affect the performance of the live, production Web App.
